      <p>Step 6: Free For All</p>
      <p>You have one on ones perfected.
        You're confident with your hero facing the odds on his or her own. It's
        now time to try the big one. The one where all your Scoobies take on a
        Hell God and her minions, the one where your X-team takes on Magneto and
        friends, the one&#8230; You get the idea.</p>
      <p> As before, you need to go
        through your location details. If you have a lot of people fighting in
        a small space, both sides are going to be hampered to an extent, with
        the one with the fewest numbers probably coming off best. (Why? Because
        the opponents have fewer targets and are likely to get in each other's
        way in trying to get to those fewer targets.)</p>
      <p>Weapons choice is also the
        same as before, bearing in mind that certain weapons are next to useless
        at close quarters while others are awkward to use.</p>
      <p> The number of people involved
        is something you need to consider. This applies to both sides, particularly
        if you have a very much smaller team facing a horde (for example Buffy
        and the Scoobies taking on a Hell God's army). We have read far too many
        stories that have reached the climactic battle only for the author to
        forget about a character or characters who've been important up to that
        point.</p>
      <p> Word choice is also very key.
        Short and snappy sentences to keep the action flowing fast and to keep
        the tension up. But in addition to word choice, there is also another
        language/style issue that needs to be addressed: The point of view you
        write the battle from.</p>
      <p> This isn't something we have
        mentioned before because in general terms, a one on one fight will be
        written automatically from the point of view of one of the combatants
        while a one on many fight will generally be written from the one's point
        of view. (We note that neither of these are hard and fast rules, but simply
        the general/natural trend of writing.) With a big battle, however, point
        of view does come into play as we return to the question of how best to
        translate something very visual onto the written page.</p>
      <p> With a television show or
        film, you can zoom in on different parts of the battlefield with ease
        or show the whole thing at one go. On paper, it is far harder, unless
        there's an innocent bystander who can give you the outside point of view,
        so you have two choices. Either you can use an omniscient point of view,
        or you pick limited points of view.</p>

        <tr>
          <td> <p><span class="error">Pros
              and Cons:<br>
              - P: Omniscient will allow you to show everything without having
              to break things up too much.<br>
              - C: Omniscient can be potentially confusing, particularly if up
              to that point you've been using limited points of view.<br>
              - P: Limited allows you to get very much closer to the action and
              into the head of one of the characters during the action.<br>
              - C: If you're using one character, unless that character can take
              a brief break from the action to look around, it's very difficult
              to show what's going on around them without unnecessarily chopping
              up your action with scene breaks.<br>
              - P: Limited does permit you to concentrate on only one aspect of
              the fight at a time, essentially breaking it down into a series
              of one on one fights.<br>

      <p>Which you pick will largely
        depend on what you're comfortable with and what your story requires. We
        would note, however, that if you pick omniscient please do not switch
        location mid-paragraph. Not only is this poor grammar but it is dizzying
        in a fast paced action scene and it will leave your readers confused.</p>
      <p>Tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Keep a careful tally count
          of your characters from both sides of a big battle. </li>
        <li> Location plans are especially
          useful for mapping out who is where on the battlefield.</li>
        <li> If the prospect of writing
          a battle is daunting to you, go for the limited point of view option
          which will allow you to break the battle up into some little one on
          one fights.</li>
        <li> We know that big battles
          are intimidating &#8211; we have been intimidated by our fair share
          &#8211; but the more tense and worried you are about it, the harder
          it will be, so our final word here is relax!
