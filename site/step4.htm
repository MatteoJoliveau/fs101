      <p>Step 4: Putting Pen To Paper</p>
      <p>Once you've done all your homework
        and planning, you're ready to start writing your scene. </p>
      <p>Tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relax! Fight scenes aren't
          easy, but they're not worth breaking out into a cold sweat over.</li>
        <li>When you've finished your
          first draft, put it away for a day or so, then come back to it and look
          at it objectively. This way, you will be more likely to spot the places
          that need fine tuning.</li>
        <li>Get a second opinion. Ask
          a friend to look it over and get their feedback. Ask a leading author
          in the fandom you write for if they'd mind taking a look over it for
          you (do NOT blindly email a perfect stranger your entire story, that's
          rude, may cause the victim problems, will not endear you to the victim
          and may just provoke the FS101 Hive Mind to come after you with a sharp
          object).</li>
        <li>Write your second draft.</li>
        <li>Look it over again, and
          if you're happy with it, post it.</li>
      </ul>
