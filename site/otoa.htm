      <p>Other Types of Action</p>
      <p>Much of what we've described
        for fight scenes holds good for other types of action sequence, but in
        the interests of providing an all-round action guide, here are a few brief
        notes on other types of action. (If there is a type that we don't currently
        cover, feel free to drop us an email and ask us to add it.)</p>
      <p> Chase Sequences:<br>
        Nowhere is the maxim of short and snappy more applicable than in a chase
        sequence. Possibly, it's even more applicable than in fight scenes. By
        definition, a chase needs to be fast moving and tense. Will the characters
        escape? Will they be caught? Short sentences and fragments, carefully
        used, will create that tension and pacing.</p>
      <p> Falls/Jumps:<br>
        These are a piece of action that we see abused more often than any other.
        We suspect this is because writers occasionally forget that they are dealing
        with a piece of action that is essentially very simple. As long as your
        action begins and ends, any and all description will add to the event.
        In the case of a fall or a jump, the speed/pacing is not crucial, but
        if you forget to say your character lands then you've abused the fall
        or jump.</p>
