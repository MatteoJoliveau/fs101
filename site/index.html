      <p>This web project is aimed at
        people who are attempting to write fight scenes for fiction. It is written
        from the point of view of fan fiction (although this is not fandom specific),
        but the advice could easily translate to original fiction scenarios. </p>
      <p>It contains a step by step
        guide that the authors of FS101 have put together based on our joint experiences.
        It also contains a basic weapons/jargon database to give budding fight
        scene writers a jump off point for any research they may need to undertake.</p>
      <p>You are welcome to link to
        this site, but please respect the hard work we, the authors, have put
        in and do not reproduce content without permission.</p>
      <p>Many thanks;<br>
