      <p>Introducing Fight Scenes</p>
      <p>There are a wide variety of
        action scenes and fight scenes that you will come across in your time
        as a writer. Some are easy to write. Person A walks into a room, doesn't
        see person B and is therefore surprised when Person B knocks them unconscious.
        Some are vastly more complicated. The purpose of this course is to help
        you perfect the simple ones - once you have them down, the complex ones
        are a snap.</p>
      <p> Fight
        and action sequences aren't easy. They do require practice. Sometimes,
        they require you to go the extra yard and try something for yourself.
        By this we do not mean attempting some of the gymnastics that are by definition
        involved. We are not athletes or trained gymnasts and our back wouldn't
        thank us if we tried. But what you can do is walk through the steps. If
        you've stepped forward on your left leg, how easy is it to then kick with
        your left? If you're balanced on one leg, how practical is it to throw
        a right hook?</p>
      <p> Other ways you can practice:
        Pay attention to the fight scenes you see in TV shows and films. You can
        learn a huge amount about what the human body really can and can't do
        in them. Watch professional wrestling from time to time. As fixed and
        as fake as it is in sporting terms, the gymnastics involved with the moves,
        particularly the high-flying moves, are real and it is a very real resource
        when it comes to seeing how the human body reacts in a fight.</p>
      <p> Lastly, it doesn't matter
        if you don't know your round house kicks from your thrust-parry-ripostes.
        The chances are your readers don't know that level of detail either and
        so will be confused if you just toss jargon at them; and if by chance
        they do know some form of martial arts (from fencing to judo to rapier
        work to karate) and you get your jargon wrong, you may either annoy them
        or cause them to laugh (this is something we have learned the hard way
        and would not wish the experience on anyone else).</p>
      <p>The three most common types
        of fight scene are: <br>
        One on One <br>
        Many on One <br>
        Many on Many - a mêlée or major battle, in other words </p>
      <p>All of the 'step' essays are
        broken down into two main sections. Firstly, the primary explanation,
        which is usually between three and four paragraphs. Then secondly a few
        quick tips. Anything that shows up like this:</p>
      <table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" bordercolor="#000000">
        <tr>
          <td><span class="error">Introducing
            Fight Scenes</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>is an example of what the essay
        is discussing, or is something for you to try.</p>
      <p>The first four 'step' essays
        are written from the point of view of writing One on One fights. Step
        5 introduces the idea of more than one opponent, while Step 6 deals with
        the biggest sorts of fight scenes. The last essay, 'Other Types of Action',
        deals with anything else you may come across while writing action.</p>
      <hr width="75%" align="center">
      <p>So. You have your hero, you
        have your villain. They need to have some form of confrontation and the
        chances are, that confrontation needs to be a fight of some description.
        But where do you start?</p>
