      <p>Step 1: Location, Location,
        Location</p>
      <p>Your physical location will
        have an effect on your fight so before you start writing, you need to
        be sure that you know your way around the location and have thought about
        any potential obstacles. </p>
      <p>If your characters are fighting
        in any kind of room, there may furniture that has to be considered - you
        can't have your characters just randomly walking through a table unless
        their name is Kitty Pryde. If this is a sword fight, then you also need
        to consider things like ceiling height. If it's a low ceiling, or if there
        are dangling light fittings, such as chandeliers, then it's probably not
        realistic to have two characters swinging their swords over their heads.</p>
      <table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" bordercolor="#000000">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><span class="error">Ceiling
              Height Experiment</p>
            <p><span class="error">Stand in
              the middle of the room you're currently in and hold your arm straight
              up above your head. This is your reach. See how far away your hand
              is from the ceiling. Now repeat the experiment, but holding a piece
              of wood that is roughly three feet in length (which is a reasonable
              length for a sword). This gives you the clearance you would have
              for a sword fight in this room.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p> Also
        something that needs to be considered is what kind of ground the characters
        are standing on. Sand or grit is far harder to move around on as compared
        to solid earth; a fixed rug is easier to move on than a polished wood
        floor. We aren't saying that all your fights should take place on something
        solid, firm and non-slip (that would be boring), but it is something that
        needs to be factored into your scene if you want it to sound believable.</p>
      <p>A third thing to be aware of
        is whether or not your ground is level, and for that matter, whether the
        ground is stationary - for example, if you're writing for Pirates of the
        Caribbean, you may well be writing a fight scene on the deck of a ship
        which is generally anything but level or stationary! </p>
      <p> Tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pick a location that you're
          familiar with. We don't mean limit yourself to places you've actually
          visited (that would be dull and restricting in the extreme). We do mean
          locations that your favourite show uses regularly. The more familiar
          you are with the location, the easier it is to fix it in your mind for
          writing. Once you're confident with your scenes, you can move on to
          less familiar and/or complex locations.</li>
        <li>Draw a plan of your location.
          It doesn't have to be high art, but it will help you keep the location
          straight in your mind, particularly if you're dealing with a complex
          location.</li>
        <li>Mark onto the plan the movements
          you think your characters are likely to make. Again, this will help
          you keep the location straight in your mind, it will also help you to
          avoid having your characters suddenly walk through obstacles.</li>
