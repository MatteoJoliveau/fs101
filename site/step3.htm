      <p>Step 3: Language, Timothy</p>
      <p>This can be split into two
        sections, dialogue and description. We will deal with dialogue first.</p>
      <p>In fight dialogue is something
        that is common to many fandoms:</p>
      <table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" bordercolor="#000000">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><span class="error">&quot;Slayer.&quot;/&quot;Slayee.&quot;<br>
              &quot;You cheated!&quot;/&quot;Pirate!&quot;<br>
              &quot;Just because I don't like to fight, doesn't mean I can't.&quot;</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Particularly if one of your
        characters is a smart mouth, you will need to be able to put in suitable
        dialogue as you write otherwise you will have that character acting out
        of character. As this will depend entirely on your characters and the
        fandom you are writing for, we have only two pieces of advice on this
        point. Firstly, writing out the fight 'grunts' (and this particularly
        applies to fandoms such as Power Rangers) is not a good idea and may conceivably
        reduce your readers to giggles. Focus on proper dialogue and the action
        and leave the 'hiyahs' to your reader's imagination. Secondly, mid-fight
        is not the place for a thirty-line soliloquy. Your dialogue should be
        kept short and snappy (see the three examples above).</p>
      <p>Moving onto the description,
        word choice for your description is important. Fighting and action is
        a very visual subject matter. It works very well on screen in film and
        TV, but it can be hard to translate that to the written page and it can
        lead to over description. </p>
      <p>Which of these two punches
        takes the longest to actually arrive?</p>
      <table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" bordercolor="#000000">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><span class="error">- He clenched
              his fist tightly, drew his arm back and pushed it forward at a lightning
              pace, sending it surging towards his enemy's unsuspecting jaw in
              a powerful right cross.<br>
              <span class="error">-
              He clenched his fist tightly and threw a staggering right hook that
              connected, snapping his enemy's head back with the force of the
              blow. </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The answer is the second one
        does. The first one tells you a lot about the punch, but most of that
        description gets in the way of the actual action, leaving you with the
        feeling that you're watching someone move in slow motion, and fight scenes
        should be something that feel as if they're happening at speed.</p>
      <p> To avoid the slow-mo effect,
        keep your description simple. Use short words and short sentence structures
        to give the words more bite. Fragments, particularly one word fragments,
        can be very effective. </p>
      <p>Which has more impact:</p>
      <table width="100%" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" bgcolor="#CCCCCC" bordercolor="#000000">
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p><span class="error">- He fell,
              hard, tripping on the uneven ground, leaving him robbed of breath
              and dazed. He ached so badly that he had no idea how he was going
              to stand again.<br>
              <span class="error">-
              He fell. Hard. Tripped by the uneven ground. He lay dazed and gasping
              for breath. And he ached! He had to get up. He didn't know how he'd
              ever do it again. </p>
            </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Again, it's the second one.
        Note: Fragments are grammatically incorrect (we would be remiss if we
        did not point this out!), so should be used carefully.</p>
      <p>Also to bear in mind, your
        word choice should be varied. This is a basic rule of writing - repetition
        of the same adjectives gets tedious for both reader and writer - but in
        fight scenes, you may find you're more limited. Have a good thesaurus
        and dictionary to hand (if you use the former, make sure you double check
        in the latter in case your alternative doesn't mean quite what you think)
        so that if you find yourself constantly using 'hit' you can vary it with
        'punch', 'strike', 'slap', 'thump'...</p>
      <p>Tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep it simple.</li>
        <li>Keep it short.</li>
        <li>Keep it snappy.</li>
      </ul>
